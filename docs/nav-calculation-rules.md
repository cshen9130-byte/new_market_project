# NAV Calculation Rules & Dividend Handling

## The Invariant That Must Always Hold

```
复权净值 (adj) >= 累计净值 (cum) >= 单位净值 (unit)
```

This must be satisfied for **every single row** in the NAV series, including and especially on ex-dividend dates and all dates after.

## Field Mapping

| DB / Code Field | Chinese Name | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `nav` / `unit_nav` | 单位净值 | Current unit NAV — drops on ex-dividend dates |
| `cum_nav_withdrawal` | 累计净值 | Cumulative NAV = unit + all historical dividends paid (stays flat or rises on ex-div) |
| `cumulative_nav` | 复权净值 | Reinvestment-adjusted NAV — always ≥ 累计净值 |

In `ops_team_nav_manual` the column `cumulative_nav` stores **累计净值** (not 复权净值). The 复权净值 is always **computed** by the pipeline — never stored from manual uploads.

## What Was Fixed (荣熙恒盈2号 — SBAH99)

### The 4.30 Dividend Issue

The fund paid a large dividend (~0.21/unit, ex-date ~2026-05-06 after Labour Day holiday). This caused two failures that recur if the calculation logic is changed carelessly:

**Failure 1 — adj was below cum after the ex-div date**

Root cause: `syncExDivAdjustedNav` was using `prevAdj × cum / prevCum`, which sets `adj = cum` on the ex-dividend date. Subsequent rechaining used `prevAdj × (unit / prevUnit)` (unit ratio), but `cum = unit + constant_offset` — so as unit falls below its ex-div level, adj drops below cum.

**Failure 2 — adj exploded to ~2.11 (my bad "fix")**

Root cause: A previous "fix" used `prevAdj × (prevUnit / unit)` — this multiplied adj by ~1.11× on the ex-div date, then a rebase loop multiplied ALL subsequent adj values by another ~1.09×, snowballing adj to ~2.11.

### The Correct Fixes Applied

See `lib/server/email-nav-query.ts`, functions:
- `syncExDivAdjustedNav`
- `rechainDerivedFromPrev`
- `propagateMissingAdjRows`

## Dividend (分红) Handling Method

### Step 1 — Detect the ex-dividend date (`isLikelyDividendExDate`)

A date is considered ex-dividend when ALL of the following are true:
- Unit NAV drops more than **1.5%** vs previous day (`unitDrop > 0.015`)
- Cumulative NAV stays within **±5%** of its previous level (`cumRef ≥ prevCum × 0.995` and `≤ prevCum × 1.05`)

This works because on ex-div dates: unit drops sharply (dividend paid out) while cumulative stays near its prior level (since cumulative = unit + total dividends ever paid, and the new dividend adds to the total, offsetting the unit drop).

### Step 2 — Compute adj on the ex-dividend date (`syncExDivAdjustedNav`)

Use the **dividend-reinvestment formula**:

```
D_new = (cum_today - unit_today) - (cum_prev - unit_prev)   // new dividend per unit paid
adj_today = prevAdj × (unit_today + D_new) / unit_prev
```

- `D_new` is the newly distributed dividend per unit (increase in the cum−unit gap)
- This formula treats the dividend as immediately reinvested, so adj grows by more than cum
- Result: `adj_today > cum_today` ✓

This function **skips** dates where adj is already valid (`existingAdj >= cum`), so it does not override correct values from seed files.

### Step 3 — Forward-chain adj for subsequent dates (`propagateMissingAdjRows` + `rechainDerivedFromPrev`)

For every subsequent date after the ex-div event, use the **cumulative-ratio formula** (not unit ratio):

```
adj_today = prevAdj × cum_today / cum_prev
```

This keeps `adj / cum = constant` (the ratio established on the ex-div date). Since the ratio is set above 1.0 in Step 2, `adj > cum` is guaranteed for all future dates regardless of how far unit NAV moves.

**Why not unit ratio?**  
`cum = unit + D_offset` (constant offset after dividend). If adj grows at the unit rate, adj/cum drifts below 1 when unit falls. Using the cum rate keeps adj/cum fixed.

`propagateMissingAdjRows` also sets `cum_nav_withdrawal` when it is absent, so that chains of unit-only email rows (no cumulative provided) don't lose the adj/cum ratio.

## Rules for Future Code Changes

### DO NOT touch these without re-verifying the invariant

| Function | Risk if changed |
|---|---|
| `syncExDivAdjustedNav` | Controls adj on ex-div dates — wrong formula breaks invariant immediately |
| `rechainDerivedFromPrev` | Used everywhere adj is re-derived — switching back to `unitRatio` for adj breaks invariant after unit drops |
| `propagateMissingAdjRows` | Fills adj for manual-upload rows — removing it leaves cum without adj for ops_team_nav_manual data |
| `alignPreDividendNavRows` | Sets pre-dividend rows to unit = cum = adj — threshold `hasDividendOffset > 0.05` determines which rows are "pre-dividend" |
| `finalizeNavSeries` (call order) | `syncExDivAdjustedNav` must run before `propagateMissingAdjRows`, which must run before `refreshStaleDerivedFields` |

### After any change to the NAV pipeline

Run a sanity check against 荣熙恒盈2号 (SBAH99) covering the 2026-04-30 to 2026-05-10 window and verify:
1. Every row satisfies `adj >= cum >= unit`
2. On the ex-div date (~2026-05-06), adj is slightly above cum (not equal, not far above)
3. adj/cum ratio is approximately constant after the ex-div date

You can use `scripts/ma/_check_nav_output.ts` for this:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/ma/_check_nav_output.ts
```

### Safe pattern for adding a new NAV source

Any new data source that provides rows for managed products must:
1. Map 累计净值 → `cum_nav_withdrawal` (not `cumulative_nav`)
2. Map 复权净值 → `cumulative_nav` (or leave it empty `""` to be computed)
3. If 复权净值 is not available, leave `cumulative_nav = ""` — `propagateMissingAdjRows` will fill it in

## Data Priority for 在管产品 (Managed Products)

```
ops_team_nav_manual  (highest — manual Excel uploads)
        ↓
ops_email_nav_records  (email-parsed data, excluded for dates covered by manual)
        ↓
JSON seed files in data/managed-product-nav/<beian_hao>.json
```

The managed product pipeline is in `lib/server/team-nav-manage-pg.ts → loadManagedProductNavSeries`.

## Known Limitations

- Micro-dividends where unit NAV still rises on the ex-div date (market return > dividend per unit) are **not detected** by `isLikelyDividendExDate` since there is no unit drop. For large dividends like 荣熙恒盈2号's 0.21/unit this cannot happen.
- `复权净值` is always computed, never stored from manual uploads. Slight numerical differences vs fund-manager-provided adj values are expected (~0.001–0.003 range).
